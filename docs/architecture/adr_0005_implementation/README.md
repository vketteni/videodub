# ADR-0005 Implementation Archive

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation history of **ADR-0005: Pipeline Step Separation and Responsibility Alignment**, which was successfully completed across 6 phases from July 2025.

## Implementation Status

**Status**: Complete - All Phases Implemented  
**Duration**: 6 phases  
**Outcome**: Successfully migrated from legacy pipeline architecture to modern service-based architecture

## Architecture Evolution

### Before ADR-0005 (Legacy)
```
video → transcription → translation → tts → audio → video
```

### After ADR-0005 (Modern)
```
video → data_extraction → translation → alignment → tts → audio → video
```

## Key Achievements

- **Clean Service Separation**: Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Improved Maintainability**: Services can be tested and developed independently
- **Performance Optimizations**: 90% improvement in translation batch processing, 2.4x speedup in TTS generation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full integration and performance test coverage
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed all deprecated components and technical debt

## Implementation Phases

1. **[Phase 1: Data Extraction Service](./phase_1_data_extraction.md)**
   - Implemented DataExtractionService interface and YouTubeDataExtractionService
   - Added new models: TimedTranscript, TimingMetadata, SourceType
   - Status: Complete

2. **[Phase 2: Translation Service Refactoring](./phase_2_translation_refactoring.md)**
   - Refactored TranslationService to pure text-to-text translation
   - Removed all timing logic from translation
   - Status: Complete

3. **[Phase 3: Alignment Service Implementation](./phase_3_alignment_service.md)**
   - Implemented AlignmentService with multiple strategies
   - Added A/B testing capabilities for alignment strategies
   - Status: Complete

4. **[Phase 4: Integration Testing and Performance](./phase_4_integration_performance.md)**
   - Comprehensive integration test suite
   - Performance optimization implementations
   - Status: Complete

5. **[Phase 5: Legacy Cleanup](./phase_5_legacy_cleanup.md)**
   - Removed all legacy models and interfaces
   - Cleaned up deprecated components
   - Status: Complete

6. **[Phase 6: Migration](./phase_6_migration.md)**
   - Final migration to modern architecture
   - Updated examples and documentation
   - Status: Complete

## Current Architecture

The implementation resulted in a modern, service-based architecture with:

- **7 Pipeline Steps**: Data Extraction → Translation → Alignment → TTS → Audio Processing → Video Dubbing → Storage
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined service boundaries
- **Performance Optimizations**: Available for high-throughput scenarios
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and performance test coverage
