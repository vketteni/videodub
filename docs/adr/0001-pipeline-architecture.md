# ADR 0001: Pipeline Architecture Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a robust, maintainable architecture for the VideoDub AI video translation pipeline that can handle:
- Multiple video sources (YouTube, etc.)
- Various translation models (OpenAI GPT variants)
- Multiple TTS engines (OpenAI, Google, Azure, System)
- Real-time cost tracking
- Error handling and recovery
- Extensibility for new services

## Decision
We adopt a **Service-Oriented Pipeline Architecture** with the following design principles:

### Core Components
1. **TranslationPipeline**: Main orchestrator that coordinates all services
2. **Service Interfaces**: Abstract interfaces for all major components
3. **Concrete Implementations**: Specific implementations for each service
4. **Dependency Injection**: Services injected into pipeline for testability

### Pipeline Flow
```
Video URL → VideoScrapingService → TranscriptProcessor → TranslationService → 
TTSService → AudioProcessor → VideoProcessor → StorageService → ProcessingResult
```

### Side Processes
- **CostTracker**: Real-time API usage and cost calculation
- **Logging**: Structured logging throughout execution
- **Configuration**: Centralized settings management

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modularity**: Each service can be developed and tested independently
- **Extensibility**: New services can be added without changing core pipeline
- **Testability**: Dependency injection allows easy mocking for tests
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Flexibility**: Services can be swapped (e.g., different TTS engines)

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More interfaces and abstractions to maintain
- **Performance**: Additional abstraction layers may add slight overhead
- **Learning Curve**: New developers need to understand the service architecture

## Implementation Notes
- All services implement well-defined interfaces in `core/interfaces.py`
- Pipeline orchestration handled in `core/pipeline.py`
- Concrete implementations in `services/` directory
- Configuration managed through Pydantic models in `config/`
