# ADR 0004: Pipeline Step Evaluation Framework

## Status
Superseded by integrated quality assessment approach

## Context
The VideoDub pipeline consists of multiple processing steps, each transforming data and affecting final output quality. While automated unit tests verify functional correctness, there's a critical need for **quality evaluation** and **human assessment** of pipeline outputs.

Current testing limitations:
- Unit tests verify code correctness but not output quality
- No systematic way to evaluate step-by-step pipeline performance
- Missing human-readable evaluation reports for quality assessment
- No framework for regression testing on real-world data samples
- Difficult to benchmark different processing modes and configurations
- No standardized evaluation datasets for consistent testing

This is particularly important for AI/ML components where functional correctness doesn't guarantee output quality (e.g., transcript processing, translation quality, TTS naturalness).

## Problem Statement
Production AI pipelines require both **functional testing** (does it work?) and **quality evaluation** (does it produce good results?). Current challenges include:

1. **Quality Assessment Gap**: No systematic evaluation of output quality across pipeline steps
2. **Human Evaluation Bottleneck**: Manual quality checks are ad-hoc and time-consuming
3. **Regression Detection**: Quality degradation can occur without breaking functionality
4. **Configuration Optimization**: No framework to compare different processing modes
5. **Real-world Testing**: Limited testing with diverse, realistic input data
6. **Stakeholder Communication**: No human-readable reports for non-technical stakeholders

## Decision Options

### Option 1: Extend Existing Test Suite
**Approach**: Add quality checks to existing pytest framework
- Integrate evaluation metrics into unit tests
- Add quality assertions alongside functional tests

**Pros**: Minimal additional tooling, familiar to developers
**Cons**: Mixes concerns, difficult to generate human-readable reports, limited flexibility

### Option 2: Separate Evaluation Framework
**Approach**: Create dedicated evaluation system parallel to automated tests
- Standalone evaluation scripts and datasets
- Human-readable report generation
- Configurable evaluation scenarios

**Pros**: Clear separation of concerns, flexible reporting, stakeholder-friendly
**Cons**: Additional tooling complexity, potential duplication

### Option 3: Integrated Pipeline Evaluation Platform (Recommended)
**Approach**: Build evaluation framework that integrates with existing pipeline architecture
- Leverage existing service interfaces and mock patterns
- Extend current quality scoring systems
- Generate both automated metrics and human-readable reports
- Support both development and production evaluation workflows

## Recommended Implementation

### Core Components

```python
@dataclass
class EvaluationDataset:
    """Curated dataset for pipeline step evaluation."""
    name: str
    description: str
    input_samples: List[Any]
    expected_outcomes: Optional[List[Any]] = None
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

@dataclass
class EvaluationResult:
    """Results from evaluating a pipeline step."""
    step_name: str
    dataset_name: str
    input_data: Any
    output_data: Any
    metrics: Dict[str, float]
    quality_score: float
    processing_time: float
    error_info: Optional[str] = None
    human_annotations: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

class PipelineStepEvaluator:
    """Framework for evaluating individual pipeline steps."""
    
    async def evaluate_step(
        self, 
        step_name: str, 
        dataset: EvaluationDataset, 
        config: EvaluationConfig
    ) -> List[EvaluationResult]:
        """Run evaluation on a pipeline step with given dataset."""
        
    def generate_report(
        self, 
        results: List[EvaluationResult], 
        format: ReportFormat = ReportFormat.MARKDOWN
    ) -> str:
        """Generate human-readable evaluation report."""
        
    def compare_configurations(
        self, 
        results_by_config: Dict[str, List[EvaluationResult]]
    ) -> ComparisonReport:
        """Compare different processing configurations."""
```

### Evaluation Workflow

1. **Dataset Management**:
   - Curated evaluation datasets for each pipeline step
   - Version-controlled test samples with expected outcomes
   - Diverse scenarios (edge cases, typical usage, challenging inputs)

2. **Step-by-Step Evaluation**:
   - Run individual pipeline steps with evaluation datasets
   - Capture both quantitative metrics and qualitative outputs
   - Generate before/after comparisons for human review

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Human-readable markdown/HTML reports
   - Visual comparisons and metrics dashboards
   - Actionable insights and recommendations

4. **Configuration Comparison**:
   - A/B testing different processing modes
   - Performance vs. quality trade-off analysis
   - Cost-benefit analysis for different configurations

### Integration Points

- **Existing Service Interfaces**: Leverage current pipeline step abstractions
- **Mock Framework**: Extend existing test mocks for evaluation scenarios
- **Quality Scoring**: Build on transcript processing quality metrics
- **Cost Tracking**: Integrate with existing cost analysis framework
- **Configuration System**: Use existing settings and processing modes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework

## Superseded By

This ADR was partially implemented with a separate evaluation framework (`evaluation/` directory) but was later superseded by an integrated quality assessment approach implemented directly within pipeline services.

### Current Implementation

Instead of a separate evaluation framework, the system now provides:

1. **Built-in Quality Assessment**: Each service (particularly `AlignmentService`) includes integrated quality scoring and evaluation methods
2. **A/B Testing Support**: Pipeline supports comparing multiple alignment strategies with built-in evaluation
3. **Integrated Metrics**: Quality scores, timing accuracy, and performance metrics are built into service interfaces
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration tests provide quality regression detection without separate evaluation infrastructure

### Key Differences

- **Original ADR-0004**: Proposed separate evaluation framework with dedicated datasets, evaluators, and reporting
- **Implemented Solution**: Embedded quality assessment within services, eliminating the need for separate evaluation infrastructure
- **Benefits**: Simpler architecture, better maintainability, integrated workflow

The core quality assessment needs identified in this ADR are addressed through the current service-based architecture with integrated evaluation capabilities.
