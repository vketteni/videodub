## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Translation Service Optimizations

#### Batch Size Optimization
- **Problem**: Processing segments individually with 50ms latency per call
- **Solution**: Implement larger batch sizes for translation API calls
- **Expected Improvement**: 40-60% reduction in translation time

#### Concurrent Translation
- **Problem**: Sequential processing of translation batches
- **Solution**: Process multiple batches concurrently
- **Expected Improvement**: 30-50% reduction in translation time

### 2. TTS Service Optimizations

#### Concurrent Audio Generation
- **Problem**: Sequential audio file generation (100ms per file)
- **Solution**: Generate multiple audio files concurrently
- **Expected Improvement**: 60-80% reduction in TTS time

#### Audio Queue Management
- **Problem**: Memory usage with large numbers of audio files
- **Solution**: Implement streaming audio generation with queue management
- **Expected Improvement**: Reduced memory footprint

### 3. Pipeline-Level Optimizations

#### Service Parallelization
- **Problem**: Some services can run in parallel
- **Solution**: Overlap TTS generation with alignment processing
- **Expected Improvement**: 10-20% reduction in total time

#### Resource Pooling
- **Problem**: Creating new service instances for each request
- **Solution**: Implement service connection pooling
- **Expected Improvement**: Reduced overhead, better concurrency
